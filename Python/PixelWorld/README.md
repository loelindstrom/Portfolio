<h1>PixelWorld <h4></h4></h1>
This is a project were I want to create an application which visualizes simple games.
I'll be using the in-built python 3 package Tkinter.
In the long run the hope is to be able to implement simple games like the Atari ones that an AI can train on.

The project has just started and to see the progress/history of the work you can check the log.md file in this directory.

Here's a screenshot of a simple game called dodge the rain:
