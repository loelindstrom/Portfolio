This is a project I did on the side during an AI-course.

I wanted to visualize different Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
It's not done, but I wrapped it up so it's at least runnable.
But you can only visualize Value Iteration (Dynamic programming) and then steer the agent yourself.

Main dependencies:
- tkinter
- pandas
- numpy
- PIL
