Web Programming

I've been playing around some to learn the basics of html/css/javascript.  
  
  This is a page I did in a course:<br>
  <h3>SocRob</h3>
  Live link: <a href="http://www.student.ltu.se/~loelin-8/Uppgift4a_draft/index.html">SocRob page<a>

  This is two pages I've done for fun:
  
<h3>Samba page (Caixa)</h3>
This one was actually an idea to be used for people I play samba with. A place were they can view how to play at home:

<h3>Wanna-look-cool page (Elements)</h3>
One of the firsts sites I did. I played around to make it look like those modern scrolling pages.
